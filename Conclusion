The Video Data Analytics project provides a comprehensive understanding of trendingYouTube content by analyzing video metadata such as view count, likes, dislikes, comments,category, and publication date.
By preprocessing and enriching the dataset with categorylabelsand removing inconsistencies, the project set a strong foundation for meaningful visualizationsand insights. Through statistical grouping
and graphical analysis, the project identified which videocategoriesgain the most attention. Categories like Music, Entertainment, and News &Politics werefoundto dominate in terms of both viewership and public engagement. 
These insights helpcontentcreators and marketers understand the types of content that tend to trend on the platform. Channel-level analysis revealed that a limited number of channels repeatedly producetrendingcontent, attracting high views and engagement. 
Metrics such as total likes, comments, andthenumber of days a video remained trending were analyzed to assess channel influenceandconsistency. Public engagement was measured using calculated metrics like Likes Percentage, DislikesPercentage, and Comments Percentage. 
These revealed that certain categories—suchas Comedyand Gaming—encourage more audience interaction, even if their total views are comparativelylower. This distinction is critical for identifying high-engagement content versus high-reachcontent. 
The project also featured an interactive dashboard using ipywidgets and Plotly, enablingusers to dynamically explore the most viewed channels and trending categories. Althoughsomedashboard functionalities (like additional plot buttons) remain incomplete, the frameworkiswell-positioned for extension into a real-time analytics tool. 
In conclusion, this project highlights the power of data analytics in decoding videotrendsandviewer behavior on YouTube. The findings can guide content strategy, improve audiencetargeting, and ultimately optimize visibility and performance in digital video platforms.
