10.1109/GlobConET53749.2022.9872506. Video analytics has gained immense significance from the industry and academics asitprovides simultaneous monitoring, analysis, and swift response to unforeseen circumstances. The ability to automatically identify temporal and spatial occurrences in videos andgenerateimportant insights is a key element of video analytics. The prime functionalityof Videoanalytics includes Object Detection, Anomaly Detection, and Video annotation. Videoanalytics is extremely beneficial in the security domain, and video surveillance, anapplication of video analytics, is used to identify improper behavior or anomalies. Anomalydetection is important in cybersecurity intrusion detection, systemhealth monitoring, surveillance detection in sensor networks, and law enforcement. Analysis of videos canbeachieved using Object Detection algorithms like You Only Look Once (YOLO), RegionProposals algorithms (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN), or Single Shot MultiBoxDetector (SSD). A comprehensive introduction, network architecture, andinternalmechanisms of these algorithms are presented in this paper. Furthermore, a comparativeperformance analysis of these models was conducted by evaluating the models basedonresults obtained from the implementation and studying previous research works. Wefurtherdiscuss some of the challenges encountered in video analytics and a set of possiblefutureopportunities and new perspectives on addressing them. 2.Khatri, T. Choudhury, T. P. Singh and M.

These camerascan be found at various places for surveillance, health care, emergencies and disasters. Inmodern technology, the availability of cheaper and faster communication technologiesand efficient algorithms has led to a large-scale deployment of camera networks. Now, Video Content Analysis also referred as Intelligent Video Analytics is used to detect,
track and analyze the movement and behaviors of objects and humans. This topic finds various applications because ability to recognize, track and take out
information about human activity is very much required. The more technical uses of
video content analytics are in face recognition, license plate recognition, trackingamoving object, searching for an object, identifying the geographic location of something, detecting suspicious activities etc. This paper proposes to show and reviewvariousalgorithms and steps for the applications of the video content analysis that are availablein the present date and will also highlight the problems that still exist to find correct
results. 3.Xia et al., "Video Visualization and Visual Analytics: A Task-BasedandApplication- Driven Investigation," in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systemsfor Video Technology, vol. 34, no. 11, pp. 11316-11339, Nov. 2024, doi:
10.1109/TCSVT.2024.3423402. Video data refers to digital information in the form of a series of frames or imagesrepresenting continuous motion captured by a video recording device. In variousdomains such as security, sports, education, and entertainment, a significant amount of
video data is generated and stored daily. However, analyzing these videos manuallyischallenging due to their intrinsic characteristics, including large-scale, redundancy, contextual dependencies, and multimodality. Consequently, researchers have extensivelyexplored visualization techniques to address these complexities. In this investigation, wereview the state-of-the-art techniques in video visualization and visual analysis. Initially, we provide an overview of the design space for video visualization and visual analysistechniques. Subsequently, we organize and classify these techniques based on visual
analysis tasks and application scenarios, providing detailed descriptions withineachcategory. Drawing upon a comprehensive review of existing research, we provideacritical evaluation and propose potential opportunities for future research. Additionally, we have developed a web-based survey browser for convenient exploration of our
created classification framework and the associated scholarly articles(https://zjutvis.github.io/VOVideo/).

An on-line video processing for surveillance system is a very challenging problem. The computational complexity of video analysis algorithms and the massive amount of
data to be analyzed must be considered under real-time constraints. Moreover it needs tosatisfy different criteria of application domain, such as, scalability, re-configurability, and quality of service. In this paper we propose a flexible/efficient video analysisframework for surveillance system which is a component-based architecture. The videoacquisition, re-configurable video analysis, and video storage are some of the basiccomponents. The component execution and inter-components synchronizationaredesigned for supporting the multi-cores and multi-processors architecture with multithreading implementation on .NET Framework. Experimental results on real-timemotion tracking are presented with discussion. Nowadays, there are video platforms emerging and data virtualization and predictiononthose platforms draw little attention. Related research on it is beneficial for both content
creators and advertisers as it helps decision-making. In this study, a video platforminChina called Bilibili was selected. This paper acquired the dataset froma number of toprated video uploaders in their field from a data share website and preprocess themtocombine them for each month. For each frame of the data, the number of likes, shares, comments, archives, and bullet charts was used to predict the number of views. Intheanalysis, this study mainly used random forest and sklearn to achieve the prediction. 368data points were utilized, and in each data point the amount of favorite, share, save andplay are combined to make the prediction. The prediction that is made by using randomforest is much more realistic than that made by using sklearn because some of thestatistics in the sklearn graph reach negative, which is not realistic in the real situation.
